# Background Project Sessions — Phase 4 UX design artifact (2026-07-02)

> **Sign-off gate.** Repo rule: UI work produces a *visible* design artifact BEFORE any component
> code. This is that artifact for Phase 4 (ask-on-switch dialog · switcher live rows · per-project
> Close). Nothing below is built until the user nods. Deleted in the PR that merges the epic
> (doc-lifecycle rule), like the rest of this folder.

Design language: the locked calm/dense Linear-Raycast contract (`design-reference/project/DESIGN.md`)
— one accent `#4f8cff`, functional color only, no glow/gradients. Tokens referenced below are real
(`src/renderer/src/styles/tokens.css`): `--accent`, `--ok #3ecf8e`, `--err`, `--text-2/3`, `--mono`.

Phase 4 also REMOVES the `EXPANSE_BG_SESSIONS` flag — keep-running becomes the shipped behavior,
mediated by the dialog below.

---

## 1 · Ask-on-switch dialog

Shown ONLY when the outgoing project actually has live resources (≥1 running terminal or open
preview — `countProjectSessions` + `countProjectOsr`); a dead project switches silently exactly as
today. Pipeline order is locked by the handoff: **lock → dialog → save → background/dispose → load**
(lock BEFORE the dialog so a second switch can't race it; Cancel releases the lock and stays).

Reuses the shared `Modal` + the ConfirmModal **chooser-tile** grammar (radio tiles + ghost/primary
buttons) — same 420px card, same `--accent-wash` selected tile.

```

```

- Default pick = **Keep running** (the feature's raison d'être; Enter = Switch with the default).
- Esc / backdrop = **Cancel** (fail-safe direction, same as ConfirmModal).
- Body line is assembled from live counts ("2 terminals running", "1 live preview" — singular/plural,
  omit a zero part).
- The tile sub-captions are the one place we explain consequence — body stays one sentence.
- **Remembered per project (user request 2026-07-02):** picking **Keep** sets a session-scoped
  `switchPolicy: 'keep'` on that project's `projectSessions` registry entry (dir-keyed; default
  `'ask'`). Every later switch away from that project skips the dialog and silently backgrounds —
  constant A⇄B switching never holds on a modal. **Stop everything is one-shot and never
  remembered** (destructive; asks each time it's chosen as the outgoing behavior). Policy resets
  when the user CLOSES the project (§3 ✕ → `project:closeBackground`, or the active-close path).
  **DEFAULT SCOPE = APP RUN ONLY (user-confirmed 2026-07-02):** the bare Keep memory lives
  exclusively in the Expanse app session — quit and reopen, and the FIRST switch away from any
  running project asks again. The registry entry (and its policy) dies with the run, same as the
  sessions themselves. Footer micro caption: "Remembered this app session; check above for
  forever".
- **Forever checkbox (opt-in add-on, user request 2026-07-02):** a checkbox under the tiles —
  *"Always keep this project in the background — remember even after Expanse restarts"*. Ticked +
  Keep + Switch ⇒ the policy is ALSO persisted to disk in **userData** (keyed by project dir —
  app config per ADR 0009, NEVER the project folder: `canvas.json` is git-shared, this is a
  machine preference). On later runs that project's switches are silent from the start. Keep-only:
  selecting the Stop tile dims + disables (and unticks) the checkbox. The §3 ✕ close clears BOTH
  the session policy and the persisted forever flag.
- **∞ forget badge (user request 2026-07-02 — undo the checkbox without killing work):** a
  project with the forever flag wears a small `∞` badge (accent on `--accent-wash`) on its §2
  switcher row and §4 dock card. Click = **forget**: clears the forever flag AND the session Keep
  → the very next switch away asks again. Sessions untouched — revoking a *preference* must never
  require destroying *work* (the ✕ close alone was a bad trade: kill terminals to change a
  setting). Tooltip: "Always kept in background — click to ask again".

## 2 · ProjectSwitcher — live rows

Backgrounded projects (from `project:listBackground`) surface IN the existing recents menu — no new
menu. A recents row whose dir is backgrounded gains a live dot + a right-aligned mono badge; plain
recents rows are unchanged. Menu width grows ~40px; row height unchanged (dense).

```
   ┌ Switch project ────────────────────────────┐
   │ ● my-app                    2 term · 1 prev ✕ │   ← backgrounded, running (dot --ok)
   │   other-project                             │   ← plain recent (unchanged)
   │ ● api-server                1 term        ✕ │
   │ ───────────────────────────────────────────│
   │ Open folder…                                │
   │ Create project…                             │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Dot** = 6px round, `var(--ok)`, static (no pulse — calm). It means "this project has sessions
  alive right now". `--ok` (not accent) because it is a STATUS, and the running-state green is
  already the app's semantic for alive (matches the terminal dock's usage of ok/err).
- **Badge** = `--mono` 10px `--text-3`, e.g. `2 term · 1 prev`; only the non-zero parts render.
  Counts come from `listBackgroundProjects()` (already returns `terminalsRunning` + `previews`).
- **✕** = per-row Close (hover-revealed, `--text-3` → `--err` on hover), backgrounded rows only.
  Click routes to §3 — it never switches.
- Rows stay clickable everywhere else = switch (as today).

## 3 · Per-project Close (confirm when running)

Clicking a row's ✕ when that project has running resources opens a plain two-button confirm
(no chooser — there is only one meaning):

```
        ┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
        │  Close "my-app"?                           │
        │                                            │
        │  This stops 2 running terminals (their     │
        │  processes are killed) and closes 1        │
        │  preview. The project stays on disk and    │
        │  in recents.                               │
        │                                            │
        │              [ Cancel ]  [ Stop & close ]  │
        └────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Primary button is the destructive action, labeled with the consequence ("Stop & close"), still
  the accent-filled primary (the app has no red-button grammar; the body carries the weight).
- Confirm → `project:closeBackground(dir)` (owner-checked in MAIN; only a REGISTERED backgrounded
  dir can be disposed). Row disappears from the live section; project remains a plain recent.
- Zero-resource backgrounded rows (everything exited on its own): ✕ closes silently, no modal.
- The ACTIVE project's close path (`closeActiveLiveResources`) is NOT a switcher row — it rides the
  existing window-close/quit flow and is out of scope for this menu.

## 4 · Bottom project dock (edge-hover, Task-View style) — user request 2026-07-02, refined same day

Windows-Task-View-like overview: hover the **bottom edge** → a floating, centered **project
dock** slides up (same grammar as the board dock) with one card per **SESSION project** — the
active project plus every project opened/created THIS app run (the backgrounded residents). Each
card shows a **partial view of its canvas** (thumbnail) plus the §2 live-dot/badge grammar. A
final **+** tile opens/creates another project.

```
   ┌──────────────────────────── app window ────────────────────────────┐
   │                          (canvas as usual)                         │
   │                                                                    │
   │          ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐          │
   │          │ ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐  ┌────┐    │          │
   │          │ │● my-app 2t·1p│ │● api-server 1t✕│  │    │   │          │
   │          │ │  ACTIVE      │ │              │  │  + │    │          │
   │          │ │ ┌─┐┌─┐  ┌──┐ │ │ ┌──┐ ┌─┐     │  │    │    │          │
   │          │ │ └─┘└─┘  └──┘ │ │ └──┘ └─┘     │  └────┘    │          │
   │          │ └──────────────┘ └──────────────┘            │          │
   │          └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘          │
   └═══════════════════ bottom-edge hover hot zone ═══════════════════════┘
```

- **Membership: session projects only** (registry `projectSessions` + the active dir). Cold
  recents NEVER appear here — they stay in the §2 switcher menu. So every card is real: it has
  live counts and a real snapshot.
- **Trigger**: pointer parked on the bottom edge (~2px hot zone, ~150ms intent delay — a drive-by
  never opens it). Leave / Esc / card-click closes. Coexists with the board dock: the project
  dock reveals ABOVE it (board dock stays put; hot zone is the window edge itself, below the
  dock's hover area).
- **Card** = header (live dot `--ok` when sessions alive · name · `2 term · 1 prev` badge ·
  hover-✕ on backgrounded cards → §3 confirm) + canvas thumbnail. Active card wears the 1.5px
  accent ring + `ACTIVE` micro tag; clicking it just closes the dock.
- **+ tile** (dashed border, trailing): small menu with the switcher's `Open folder…` /
  `Create project…` actions — the dock can grow the session set without a trip to the top-left.
- **Click** = switch, through the exact §1 pipeline (ask-on-switch dialog when the outgoing
  project has live resources). The dock is a second *presentation* of the same actions — zero new
  switch semantics.
- **Thumbnail = static snapshot, never a live render.** Captured MAIN-side via
  `webContents.capturePage(canvasRect)` (downscaled ~2×) at two moments: the outgoing project at
  **switch-away** (inside `performProjectSwitch`, before unmount) and the active project on
  **dock-open**. Cached under `userData/project-thumbs/<dirHash>.png` (app cache, NOT the project
  folder — ADR 0009 stays clean), served to the renderer as a data URL over IPC. Capture-failure
  fallback: dot-grid placeholder. Rendering N background canvases live is explicitly out of scope
  (one React Flow instance per app, by design).
- Solid surfaces only (`--surface` panel, `--surface-raised` cards) — no blur/glassmorphism
  (locked contract).
- Suggested build order: Phase 4a = §1–3 (dialog · menu rows · close), Phase 4b = the dock
  (needs the snapshot capture plumbing).

## Out of scope (locked)

- No "remember my choice" on the dialog (revisit only if the dialog proves naggy — it shows only
  when something is actually running).
- No background-resource cap UI (GLOBAL_OSR_MAX handles previews silently; Phase 5 ADR documents it).
- No badge/dot in the title-bar pill for the ACTIVE project — the pill stays as-is.
