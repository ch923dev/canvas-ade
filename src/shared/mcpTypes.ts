/**
 * Cross-bundle MCP type contract — TYPE-ONLY.
 *
 * Imported by both MAIN (`src/main/`) and the renderer (`src/renderer/src/`) as
 * `import type { … } from '../shared/mcpTypes'` (MAIN) / `'../../../shared/mcpTypes'`
 * (renderer depth). Contains NO value exports and NO Node/Electron/DOM imports — so it
 * compiles cleanly under tsconfig.node, tsconfig.preload, and tsconfig.web, and is erased
 * entirely at build time (no `require()`/`import()` in any output bundle).
 *
 * Single source of truth for:
 *   McpCommand                 — the MAIN → renderer control-plane union
 *   McpCommandAck              — the renderer → MAIN ack
 *   PlanningOp / PlanningOpTint — planning-element write-op types
 *   AuditEntry / AuditInput    — MCP dispatch audit-trail entry shapes
 *
 * 🔒 Do not add value exports or Node/DOM/Electron imports to this file. A value export
 * would be bundled into the renderer; if it transitively pulled in MAIN's Node built-ins
 * the renderer bundle would break. Keeping this file declaration-only is the safeguard.
 *
 * (W1-D / F9: extracted from the formerly hand-mirrored copies in `src/main/mcpCommand.ts`,
 * `src/main/auditLog.ts`, `src/renderer/src/store/useMcpCommands.ts`,
 * `src/renderer/src/store/planningMcpApply.ts`, and `src/renderer/src/canvas/AuditLogViewer.tsx`.)

/**
 * One SANITIZED, fully-normalized planning-element write op (S2), MAIN → renderer. The
 * orchestrator's `addPlanningElements` validates + sanitizes + caps the agent's content
 * BEFORE minting these (so the renderer receives clean, fully-specified ops: `tint` and
 * item `done` are no longer optional). The renderer materializes each into a full
 * `PlanningElement` — minting ids, stacking positions below existing content, and default
 * sizes — and re-validates against the schema (defense in depth) before it lands. The schema
 * kinds that carry agent content are expressible (note · checklist · text · arrow · diagram); a
 * `diagram` carries a Mermaid `source` the renderer materializes into a `DiagramElement` (host
 * schema v11) and renders to a themed SVG in the sandboxed worker. 🔒 Untrusted passive content:
 * it renders, never auto-arms an action.
 *
 * Every op may carry an optional sanitized `section` (2a) — a short column label MAIN passes
 * through from the agent. The renderer groups ops by `section` and lays out one column per section
 * (first-appearance order). Layout-only: it drives `x/y` at materialize time and is never persisted
 * on the resulting `PlanningElement` (so no schema bump). Absent everywhere → the renderer's masonry.

// ── Command union (formerly hand-mirrored in mcpCommand.ts + useMcpCommands.ts) ──

/**
 * Control-plane command envelope, MAIN → renderer — the inverse of the `mcp:boards`
 * mirror (which carries board facts renderer → MAIN). This is how the MCP layer *drives*
 * the canvas once it gains write tools. MAIN's `sendMcpCommand` serializes a value of this
 * type; the renderer's `applyMcpCommand` switches on it and acks on the CSPRNG reply channel.
 *
 * Adding a variant here propagates the type error to BOTH sides simultaneously — the
 * compile-time safety this shared module exists to enforce (W1-D / F9).
 *
 * - `addBoard` carries only a MINIMAL spec (id + type), NOT a full PersistedBoard: MAIN mints
 *   the id but does not know canvas geometry, so the renderer builds the full board (free-slot
 *   placement, per-type defaults) from this spec. `board.type` is a loose `string` (MAIN is the
 *   sender and does not import renderer types); the renderer re-validates it against its
 *   SPAWNABLE allowlist at runtime (defense in depth — the value crosses IPC as JSON anyway).
 * - `removeBoard` (T3.2) tears one down by id.
 * - `configureBoard` (T3.3) changes a board's durable per-type config (the renderer applies it
 *   through `updateBoard`, which filters to PATCHABLE_KEYS).
 * - `patchPlanning` (S2) appends agent-authored CONTENT (notes/checklists/text/arrows) to a
 *   planning board's `elements`; the ops are already validated + sanitized + capped + human-
 *   confirmed by the orchestrator before this carries them.
 * - `spawnGroup` (PR-5b) creates a whole feature-zone cluster — a terminal (always) + an
 *   optional planning + browser member, plus a Named Group over them and the browser→terminal
 *   preview wiring — in ONE undoable step. MAIN mints every id (so the tool can return them and
 *   later lifecycle tools can address each member); the renderer lays out the cluster (free-slot
 *   placement, per-type defaults) and folds the browser's `previewSourceId` onto the terminal.
 *   Content-less like `addBoard` (empty boards), so it is cap-checked, not human-gated.
