/**
 * 🔒 Dispatch payload sanitizer (M4 hardening, HIGH).
 *
 * A dispatch (`handoff_prompt` / `assign_prompt` / `relay_prompt`) writes the prompt into
 * a target board's PTY and the caller appends a SINGLE carriage return so the shell runs
 * ONE line. The human-confirm modal shows that one line and authorizes it. If the prompt
 * text itself carried an embedded CR/LF, the PTY would see multiple Enters → MULTIPLE
 * shell commands would run from a single approval (one confirm → N commands). That breaks
 * the M4 invariant "what the human approves is exactly what runs", and is the lethal-trifecta
 * lever (a worker's tainted output relayed + rubber-stamped).
 *
 * So: a dispatch is EXACTLY ONE command line. Reject any embedded CR/LF (the dispatch
 * fails — the agent must resend a single command, never silently flattened). Strip the
 * other C0 control chars (0x00-0x1F) + DEL (0x7F) + C1 controls (0x80-0x9F) — ESC and
 * friends are a terminal-escape injection surface and carry no legitimate command meaning
 * here; the C1 range is the 8-bit encoding of exactly those escapes (CSI/OSC/DCS/NEL).
 * The trailing CR that actually submits the line is added by the caller, NEVER by this
 * function.
